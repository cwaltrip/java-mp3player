# java-mp3player

A basic audio player for MP3 files. It uses the [BasicPlayer API 3.0](http://www.javazoom.net/jlgui/api.html) for Java MP3 support. 

This is very much a work in progress. Currently it displays a Swing GUI window that allows you to add and remove files in a playlist, and perform the expected play/pause/stop/next/previous operations via button controls.

Planned improvements include:
- saving and loading of playlists
- drag-and-drop reordering of the current playlist
- shuffle play
- a better GUI, implemented in JavaFX

Thanks and credit to [Pierluigi Montagna](http://pievisdev.blogspot.com) for an enlightening tutorial and several utility classes.
